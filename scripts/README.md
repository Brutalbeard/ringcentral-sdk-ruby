Scripts
=======

## Overview

This folder contains scripts, programs, and examples. Some of the programs
here may be demonstrations only while others may be usable in production by a
number of users.

To contribute to community adoption of the RingCentral Ruby SDK, please add
your scripts and programs to this folder. Include a brief comment at
the beginning of your source describing what it does.

## Credentials

Many of the scripts in this folder use a `credentials.json` file to hold
application and user credentials. To create your own file, copy the sample
file `_credentials_sample.json` to `credentials.json` and add your own
information.
